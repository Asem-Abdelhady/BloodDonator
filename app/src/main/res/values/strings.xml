    <string name="about">We are two students from Menofia STEM School that are working to solve Egypt problems in the field of public health, specifically blood donation. For our senior year project, we are developing a mobile application that help making a connection between all the blood patients and the nearest donors in order to aid the process of blood donation. Briefly, this will be done by decreasing the time required for the blood sample and for finding a matching donor. We are using JAVA programming language to build the architecture of the app and fire base to create the database. We hope that our application will affect our community and solve this problem if applied and widely used between the healths institutions.</string>
